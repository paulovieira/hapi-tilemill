LetsMove
========

A sample project that demonstrates how to move a running Mac OS X application to the Applications folder.


Version History
---------------

* 1.6.2
	- Garbage collection compatibility added
	- Use a new method to check if an application is already running on Mac OS X 10.6 systems or higher

* 1.6.1
	- Use exit(0) to terminate the app before relaunching instead of [NSApp terminate:]. We don't want applicationShouldTerminate or applicationWillTerminate NSApplication delegate methods to be called, possibly introducing side effects.
